# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for prework for the full stack course. 

I wanted to learn how to code, followed a course teaching me how, it taught me how to make a simple page, how HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript all work together.  I also learned about the importance of README files.
